# Question Answering system

Here, I have tried to implement a Question Answering (QA) system using NLP features and techniques for the 
following type: 
1. WHO questions 
2. WHEN questions
3. WHERE questions 

### Prerequisites and Installation

1. Python3

For windows:
* [Python Installation](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

For Mac:

Use the command:

```
brew install python3
```

2. Packages – nltk

For Windows:

* [Canopy Installation](https://store.enthought.com/downloads/)

For Mac/Unix: Canopy is not required, download packages using pip.

```
sudo pip install -U nltk
```
3. Packages – spacy

For Windows/Mac/Unix:

```
sudo pip install -U spacy
```

These commands assume you already have pip installed.

## Running the tests

Sample Commands: 

```
$$ python3 main.py
```
This code assumes the questions for the bot are in questions.txt. The dataset for this bot is provided in dataset folder. 

## Results
The program writes the answers in file called - data.txt. Example answers to questions from questions.txt is present in data.txt file.
